# 06-Juicy-Breakout

This was a project for my Game Technology Course at IU based on the video "Juice it or Lose it."

The goal of the assignment was to take a simple clone of break out and add several new features to make the game more juicy (feels like it has polish) 

I added 16 feature of my own:
1.	Added background
2.	Gave color to ball, paddle and blocks
3.	Animate how blocks and paddle appear onscreen
4.	Squeeze and shake paddle
5.	Wobble ball after it hits something
6.	Animate the color of the ball after it hits something
7.	Blocks fall when hit
8.	Blocks rotate when hit
9.	Blocks darken when hit. 
10.	Particle effect when block is hit
11.	Comet trail added to ball
12.	Animated sprite added to game over screen
13.	Animated sprite added to Win screen 
14.	Added screen shake
15.	Added sound effect when block is hit
16.	Added background music (music by https://patrickdearteaga.com/)
